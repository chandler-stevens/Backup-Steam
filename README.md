# Backup-Steam
Sync Steam Games and Mods to Backup Drive

Requires a Windows PC and an installation of Python 3

You may need to edit the drive letters for the "manifests", "source", and "destination" variables near the beginning of the "backup" function.
For example, my Steam drive is "D:", but yours may be "C:", so you will have to change "manifests" and "source" to begin with 'C'.
My external hard drive for games is "E:", but yours may be "G:", so you will have to change the "destination" in "backup-games.py" to begin with 'G'.
My external hard drive for mods is "F:", but yours may be "H:", so you will have to change the "destination" in "game-mods-backup.py" to begin with 'H'.
